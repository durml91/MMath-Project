# Preliminary investigation of diffusion models

Playing around with the basics of diffusion models. Some of this code is **not** mine and is duly cited. In particular Patrick Kidger (Equinox) - *"Patrick Kidger and Cristian Garcia. “Equinox: neural networks in JAX via callable PyTrees and filtered transformations”. In: Differentiable Programming workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems 2021 (2021)."* and *"Karm Patel. diffusion spiral non neural.ipynb. 2022. url: https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book2/25/diffusion_spiral_non_neural.ipynb."*. Also Google_Simple_Diffusion has just been hooked from another repository.
