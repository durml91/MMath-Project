# Diffusion + RL

Investigating the two ideas based on the paper "Diffusion Policies as an Expressive Policy Class for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by
Zhendong Wang, Jonathan J Hunt and Mingyuan Zhou (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06193). Includes my own implementation in JAX and a copy of the authors' implementation in PyTorch (https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Diffusion-Policies-for-Offline-RL.git).
